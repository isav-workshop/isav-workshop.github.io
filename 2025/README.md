# ISAV 2025: In Situ AI, Analysis and Visualization

<p style="text-align: left;" markdown="1">

*Proposed workshop* -- In conjunction with:
[SC25, The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis](https://sc25.supercomputing.org)
<br>

</p>

## Workshop Theme

As HPC platforms and applications increase significantly in size, complexity, and heterogeneity, one major challenge is the widening gap between computation and our ability to gain insight from extreme-scale data and make timely, data-driven decisions.
A well-known, yet challenging, approach is in situ processing â€“ performing as much analysis as possible while computed data is still resident in memory.

This is the 11th year of the In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV) workshop. We celebrate that in situ processing has evolved from research efforts to a central component in supercomputer, cloud and edge applications.
In situ methods are in high demand: in system-scale 3D visualization for the latest Exascale supercomputers, in cloud products providing responsive user experiences, in tightly coupled digital twins, and in computational sciences.
Each one of these examples has a different set of requirements in response time, data throughput and complexity of data pipelines, and more exploration in the in situ space is needed to address multifaceted goals: (1) to preserve important elements of simulations, (2) to significantly reduce the data needed to preserve these elements, (3) to offer as much flexibility as possible for post-processing exploration, and (4) to accelerate the gathering of insights to be fast enough to make timely decisions based on it.

ISAV is a community of in situ developers, practitioners, researchers, and users of in situ methods and infrastructure, connecting industry, government laboratories, and academia across all career levels.
Through presentations and discussions of research findings, lessons learned, and early ideas, ISAV illuminates new requirements and gaps driven by science and engineering applications, and fosters the community members and knowledge base around the development and application of in situ methods with its peer-reviewed proceedings.

## Participation/Call for Papers

Coming soon!

## Review Process

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process consisting of three reviews by experts in the field, and evaluated according to relevance to the workshop theme, technical soundness, creativity, originality, and impact of method/results.

## Submission Process

Coming soon!


## Publication in proceedings, presentation at the workshop

All paper submissions that receive favorable reviews will be included as part of the workshop proceedings, which will be published. Subject to the constraints of workshop length, some subset of the accepted publications will be invited to give a brief oral presentation at the workshop. The exact number of such presentations and their length will be determined after the review process has been completed.

## Timeline/Important Dates

Coming soon!
