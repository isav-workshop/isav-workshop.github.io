# ISAV 2025: In Situ AI, Analysis and Visualization

## Workshop Theme

As HPC platforms and applications increase significantly in size, complexity, and heterogeneity, one major challenge is the widening gap between computation and our ability to gain insight from extreme-scale data and make timely, data-driven decisions.
A well-known, yet challenging, approach is in situ processing – performing as much analysis as possible while computed data is still resident in memory.

This is the 11th year of the ISAV workshop, and we are expanding the workshop's scope to In Situ AI, Analysis and Visualization.
Furthermore, we are expanding the workshop's technical program to now accept full paper submissions.
We celebrate that in situ processing has evolved from research efforts to a central component in supercomputer, cloud and edge applications.
In situ methods are in high demand:
* in training ML/AI surrogate models or leveraging ML/AI models for analysis,
* in system-scale 3D visualization for the latest Exascale supercomputers,
* in cloud products providing responsive user experiences,
* in tightly coupled digital twins, and in computational sciences.

Each one of these examples has a different set of requirements in response time, data throughput and complexity of data pipelines, and more exploration in the in situ space is needed to address multifaceted goals: (1) to preserve important elements of simulations, (2) to significantly reduce the data needed to preserve these elements, (3) to offer as much flexibility as possible for post-processing exploration, and (4) to accelerate the gathering of insights to be fast enough to make timely decisions based on it.


ISAV'25 brings together the broader HPC community and researchers, developers and practitioners from industry, academia, and government laboratories who are developing, applying, and deploying scalable in situ methods at any high performance platform.
The goal is to present research findings, lessons learned, and insights related to developing and applying in situ methods across a range of science and engineering applications in scalable environments; to discuss topics like opportunities presented by new workflows in AI/ML, modeling, data processing, emerging architectures, infrastructure needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and enable in situ AI, analysis, and visualization.
Since its inception in 2015, ISAV has fostered and catered a diverse audience and supported early career members, becoming a "center of gravity" for researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods, software and integrations in the HPC space.
Through presentations and discussions of research findings, lessons learned, and early ideas, ISAV illuminates new requirements and gaps driven by science and engineering applications, and fosters the community members and knowledge base around the development and application of in situ methods with its peer-reviewed proceedings.

## Participation/Call for Papers

In its 11th year ISAV is expanding in scope and technical focus, and now invites full paper submissions up to 10 pages (including references) and works on in situ AI/ML training or inference. ISAV also continues to invite short papers (5 page + 1 page references) and lightning talk abstracts (1 page).

Full papers should present research results, identity opportunities or challenges, or present case studies/best practices for in situ methods. Short papers may also document late breaking ideas & early progress on novel concepts. Lightning talks are encouraged to present preliminary works or ideas to foster discussion with the community. Full and short papers will appear in the workshop proceedings and authors will be invited to give an oral presentation at the workshop; lightning talks will be invited to give brief oral presentations at the workshop.

Submissions of all types may identify opportunities, challenges and best practices for in situ AI/ML, in situ analysis and in situ visualization. They may propose new methods and techniques, provide positions, or experience reports on in situ analysis, learning and visualization. Areas of interest for ISAV include, but are not limited to:

* Methods, Algorithms and Synthesis between HPC & ML: In situ analysis (feature detection, data reduction/compression, data summarization, ML training) and scientific visualization using data-driven, surrogate-assisted, statistical, temporal, geometric, or time-varying methods.
* Applications and Workflows: Applications (simulations, data processing, scientific user facilities) and integrations into digital twins.  Workflows for supporting complex in situ processing pipelines (incl. enabling accelerated post-processing and elasticity), their resilience (error detection, data congestion, fault recovery) and reproducibility.
* Scalability Requirements: Scalability, resource utilization, data flow, and simplified access to extreme heterogeneous resources.  Real-time coupling of data (modeled or measured), surrogates and algorithms.
* Case Studies, Data Sources and Best Practices & Usability: Examples/case studies of solving a specific science challenge with in situ methods/infrastructure.  In situ methods/systems applied to data from simulations, and/or observations/experiments.  Deployments & software engineering.
* Software Evolution & Standardization: In situ libraries from research prototypes to production quality. Challenges, opportunities, gaps in existing capabilities. API designs and development of community standards.
* Enabling Hardware & Emerging Architectures: Hardware & emerging system architectures that provide opportunities for in situ processing.  Efficient use of hardware accelerators and heterogeneous architectures, incl. HPC, Data Center or Edge.


## Review Process

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process consisting of three reviews by experts in the field, and evaluated according to relevance to the workshop theme, technical soundness, creativity, originality, and impact of method/results.

## Submission Process

Authors are invited to submit full or short papers, or lightning talk abstracts. Full papers should be 10 pages (including references), short papers should be 5 pages + 1 for references. Papers must be submitted in PDF format (readable by Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 and higher) and formatted for 8.5in x 11in (U.S. Letter).

All authors must use the new proceedings templates and the CCS2012 guide that are available at: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html.

We believe that reproducible science is essential, and that SC should be a leader in this effort. As a consequence, ISAV 2025 participates in the SC reproducibility initiative and encourages submitters to include an appendix with reproducibility information. While we will not disqualify a paper based on information provided or not provided in this appendix, nor if the appendix is not available, the availability and quality of an appendix will be used in ranking a paper. For more information, see the [ISAV reproducibility FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dL8kgFOyGtCniRXIzmozi_NGEVBvUe3AQ05qe1du4u4/edit#heading=h.mga5xfgyjgtp).

Papers must be self-contained and provide the technical substance required for the program committee to evaluate their contributions. Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.


## Publication in proceedings, presentation at the workshop

All paper submissions that receive favorable reviews will be included as part of the workshop proceedings, which will be published. Subject to the constraints of workshop length, some subset of the accepted publications will be invited to give a brief oral presentation at the workshop. The exact number of such presentations and their length will be determined after the review process has been completed.
