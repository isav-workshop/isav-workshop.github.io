title: "ISAV 2022: In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-scale Analysis and Visualization"
description: >
  A workshop to be held in conjunction with SC22 in Dallas, TX.
  This workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners from
  industry, academia, and government laboratories who use in situ methods in
  extreme-scale, high performance computing. The goal is to present existing
  in-situ infrastructures, reference examples in a range of science and
  engineering applications, to discuss topics like opportunities presented by new
  architectures; existing infrastructure needs, requirements, and gaps; and
  experiences to foster and enable in situ analysis and visualization.

## Workshop Theme
The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ analysis and visualization is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first storing to a file system. Second is the potential for increased accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available resources, CPUs and accelerators, in the computation of analysis products.

The workshop brings together researchers, developers and practitioners from industry, academia, and government laboratories developing, applying, and deploying in situ methods in extreme-scale, high performance computing. The goal is to present research findings, lessons learned, and insights related to developing and applying in situ methods and infrastructure across a range of science and engineering applications in HPC environments; to discuss topics like opportunities presented by new architectures, existing infrastructure needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and enable in situ analysis and visualization; to serve as a "center of gravity" for researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods and infrastructure in the HPC space.
