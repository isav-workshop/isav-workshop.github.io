## Workshop Theme

HPC platforms and applications have reached such large scale, complexity, and heterogeneity, that a major challenge has become the wide gap between our ability to compute extreme-scale data and our ability to gain insight from it to make timely, data-driven decisions. A well-known, yet challenging, approach to visual analysis, learning, and processing is performing the tasks in situ, i.e., while the data is still in memory, potentially in lieu of saving the raw data out. Since 2015, ISAV has fostered a community of in situ developers, practitioners, researchers, and users of in situ methods and infrastructure, connecting industry, government laboratories, and academia across all career levels. Through presentations, discussions, and peer-reviewed proceedings of research findings, lessons learned, and early ideas, ISAV illuminates new requirements and gaps driven by science and engineering applications and fosters the application of in situ methods.

This is the 12th year of the ISAV workshop, continuing from last year we now invite full paper submissions, and in situ methods on ML/AI.
Furthermore, we are expanding the lightning talks track to a "Community Talks" track, which invites members of the in situ community to share early research ideas, hands-on practical learnings, insights into creative solutions, etc., with more emphasis on practical experiences and knowledge sharing

We celebrate that in situ processing has evolved from research efforts to a central component in supercomputer, cloud and edge applications.
In situ methods are in high demand:
* in training ML/AI surrogate models or leveraging ML/AI models for analysis,
* in system-scale 3D visualization for the latest Exascale supercomputers,
* in cloud products providing responsive user experiences,
* in tightly coupled digital twins, and in computational sciences.

Each one of these examples has a different set of requirements in response time, data throughput and complexity of data pipelines, and more exploration in the in situ space is needed to address multifaceted goals: (1) to preserve important elements of simulations, (2) to significantly reduce the data needed to preserve these elements, (3) to offer as much flexibility as possible for post-processing exploration, and (4) to accelerate the gathering of insights to be fast enough to make timely decisions based on it.


ISAV'26 brings together the broader HPC community and researchers, developers and practitioners from industry, academia, and government laboratories who are developing, applying, and deploying scalable in situ methods at any high performance platform.
The goal is to present research findings, lessons learned, and insights related to developing and applying in situ methods across a range of science and engineering applications in scalable environments; to discuss topics like opportunities presented by new workflows in AI/ML, modeling, data processing, emerging architectures, infrastructure needs, requirements, and gaps, and experiences to foster and enable in situ AI, analysis, and visualization.
Since its inception in 2015, ISAV has fostered and catered a diverse audience and supported early career members, becoming a "center of gravity" for researchers, practitioners, and users/consumers of in situ methods, software and integrations in the HPC space.
Through presentations and discussions of research findings, lessons learned, and early ideas, ISAV illuminates new requirements and gaps driven by science and engineering applications, and fosters the community members and knowledge base around the development and application of in situ methods with its peer-reviewed proceedings.

## Participation/Call for Papers

Coming soon

## Review Process

All submissions will undergo a peer-review process consisting of three reviews by experts in the field, and evaluated according to relevance to the workshop theme, technical soundness, creativity, originality, and impact of method/results.

## Submission Process

Coming soon

## Publication in proceedings, presentation at the workshop

All paper submissions that receive favorable reviews will be included as part of the workshop proceedings, which will be published. Subject to the constraints of workshop length, some subset of the accepted publications will be invited to give a brief oral presentation at the workshop. The exact number of such presentations and their length will be determined after the review process has been completed.

## Timeline/Important Dates
